# nbmoody.com
An under-construction portfolio website using the MEAN stack, and MVC architecture. As this project stands, it is a complete Node/Express app using an API to call data from an mLab instance of MongoDB.
* Note: Any image-paths for this application must have the file extensions saved in lowercase, because Heroku (the cloud-platform this app is deployed to) is case-sensitive, unlike many local systems.

## Stage 1
This is nearly completed with the initial commit, but I'm hoping to spin-up a static Node/Express site (with bootstrap, fontawesome, and pug) as the basis upon which I'll build, extending into a truly mean-stack website.

## Stage 2
The idea at this point would be to connect the site to a MongoDB instance on the cloud using mLab.

## Stage 3
With time, the site could be extended using some Angular, or even overhauled and turned into an SPA web-application of sorts. We'll see if I'm able to make it this far.
