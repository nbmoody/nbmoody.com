An under-construction portfolio website using the MEAN stack.

## Stage 1
This is nearly completed with the initial commit, but I'm hoping to spin-up a static site as the basis upon which I'll build, extending into a truly mean-stack website.

## Stage 2
The idea at this point would be to add some Angular to the Node/Express setup.

## Stage 3
Hoping to round out the process with some MongoDB here.
