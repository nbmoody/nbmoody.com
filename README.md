An under-construction portfolio website using the MEAN stack, and MVC architecture (The "model" part will be coming later in development).

## Stage 1
This is nearly completed with the initial commit, but I'm hoping to spin-up a static Node/Express site (with bootstrap, fontawesome, and pug) as the basis upon which I'll build, extending into a truly mean-stack website.

## Stage 2
The idea at this point would be to connect the site to a MongoDB instance on the cloud using mLab.

## Stage 3
With time, the site could be extended using some Angular, or even overhauled and turned into an SPA web-application of sorts. We'll see if I'm able to make it this far.
